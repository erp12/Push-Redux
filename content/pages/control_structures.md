Title: Control Structures

Control structures determine the flow of a program; they dictate the order in which code is executed. Some familiar examples include loop and if-statement variations. In Clojush, control structures can be manipulated from both the CODE and EXEC stack. As such, instruction names will begin with either code_ or exec_. For instance, there are two variations of the do\*range instruction: exec_do\*range and code_do\*range. The difference between these instructions is the type of stack on which they are pushed. 

Some examples of the more commonly used control structures include exec_noop, exec_do\*count, exec_while, exec_do\*while, exec_if, and exec_do\*times. All of the instructions mentioned exist for the code stack as well. Descriptions of most of the control instructions can be found [here](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push3-description.html#Push3%20vs.%20Push2). While this catalog is not syntactically up to date, the behavior of many of the current Clojush instructions conform to the descriptions listed.
